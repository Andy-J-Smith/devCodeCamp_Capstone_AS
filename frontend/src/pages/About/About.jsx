<main>
    <p>
    We are located on the beautiful banks of the Tombigbee River in West-Central Alabama. 
    Our pro-staff are avid fishermen just like you! So, we know what it takes to catch that
    trophy fish...Or just load the boat for a fish fry!
    </p>
    
    <p>
    We are a veteran owned company that loves to catch fish and enjoy the outdoors!
    We even include a bonus bait, hand tied by our owner, the <span>Bigbee Slab</span> himself!
